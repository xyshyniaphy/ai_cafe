# Session Summary: AI Net Cafe Hunter Project

This session focused on the initial specification, setup, and implementation of the "AI Net Cafe Hunter" project.

## 1. Project Scoping and Specification

-   **Initial Goal:** A request was made to create a specification for an AI agent that finds the cheapest net cafe in Japan near a given train station.
-   **`spec.md` Creation:** A detailed specification file (`spec.md`) was created, outlining:
    -   **Objective:** Find the cheapest overnight net cafe stay.
    -   **Technologies:** Python/uv, SearxNG, Headless Chrome (Selenium), BeautifulSoup, Langgraph, and Gemini Flash.
    -   **Workflow:** A multi-step process from search, scraping, and data cleaning to LLM analysis and final reporting.
    -   **Configuration:** Use of a `.env` file for settings.
-   **Refinements:** The specification was later updated to be more specific about using a `localhost` SearxNG instance, saving reports in Markdown format, and expanding the `.env` file to include more detailed operational parameters like `MAX_CAFES_TO_SEARCH` and `MAX_PRICE_JPY`.

## 2. Project Structure and Setup

-   A complete project directory structure was created based on the specification, including:
    -   `data/` and `llm_reports/` directories.
    -   `.gitignore` file configured for the project.
    -   An expanded `.env` file with default values for all new configuration parameters.
    -   Placeholder `main.py` and `requirements.txt` files.

## 3. Implementation of the Scraping Module

-   **Dependencies:** The `requirements.txt` file was populated with necessary libraries (`selenium`, `beautifulsoup4`, `requests`, etc.).
-   **Scraping Script:** The `main.py` file was implemented with the initial logic to:
    1.  Accept a train station name as a command-line argument.
    2.  Query the SearxNG instance.
    3.  Use Selenium and BeautifulSoup to scrape and parse the resulting URLs.
    4.  Clean and save the text content to the `data/` directory.

## 4. Troubleshooting and Current Status

-   **Dependency Installation:** The initial package installation failed due to the lack of a Python virtual environment. This was resolved by creating one with `uv venv`.
-   **Execution Errors:** The script initially failed to run due to using the wrong Python interpreter. This was corrected by explicitly using the interpreter in the `.venv` directory.
-   **Connection Failure:** The script is currently blocked because it cannot connect to the required SearxNG service at `http://localhost:8888`. An attempt to locate a `docker-compose.yml` file to self-start the service was unsuccessful.

## 5. Retry and Further Troubleshooting

-   **Retry Command:** Following a "retry" request, the scraping script was executed again.
-   **Persistent Failure:** The script failed with the identical "Connection refused" error, confirming the SearxNG service was still not accessible.
-   **Diagnostic Attempt:** An attempt was made to diagnose the network issue by checking for listening services on port 8888 using the `ss` command. This operation was cancelled by the user.

**Updated Conclusion:** The project remains blocked pending the availability of the local SearxNG service.
