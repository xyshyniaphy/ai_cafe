# Next Steps to Unblock the AI Net Cafe Hunter Project

## The Problem

The scraping script (`main.py`) cannot proceed because it is unable to connect to the SearxNG search engine. The script requires a running SearxNG instance to find the websites of net cafes.

**Error Message:** `Connection refused` to `http://localhost:8888`.

This means that no service is currently running and listening on port 8888 on your local machine.

## Required Action

You need to **start your local SearxNG instance** so that it is accessible at the configured URL.

### How to Do It (General Guidance)

The exact steps depend on how you have installed SearxNG. Here are the most common scenarios:

#### 1. If you are using Docker (Recommended)

-   Navigate to the directory containing your SearxNG `docker-compose.yml` file.
-   Run the following command to start the service in the background:
    ```bash
    docker-compose up -d
    ```
-   Verify that the containers are running and that the web application is mapped to port 8888.

#### 2. If you installed it from source

-   You will need to follow the SearxNG documentation to start the web server.
-   Typically, this involves activating a Python virtual environment and running a command like:
    ```bash
    python searx/webapp.py
    ```
-   Ensure that the configuration is set to bind to `0.0.0.0` (to be accessible from outside the container if applicable) and listen on port `8888`.

## After Starting the Service

Once the SearxNG instance is running and you can access its web interface in your browser at `http://localhost:8888`, you can simply tell me to **"retry"** the scraping process.
